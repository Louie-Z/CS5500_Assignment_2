**Project Name:** A Better Calc/sheet

**Team Name:** Team Name

## Introduction
When a team undertakes a new task the first step in the process is often called Discovery.  The outcome of the discovery stage is a high-level plan of how to solve the problem.  In this particular exercise we want you to produce a document that outlines how your team is going to address tackling the three sub-projects.  This document should be your plan of action. 

## Sub-Project 1: File Selection

### Objectives

- have a file selector page
    - request a list of all the documents from the backend server
    - display them on a separate page

### Plan of Action
    1. Frontend Development:
        Create a dedicated web page for the file selector.
        Design an intuitive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    2. Document Listing:
        Develop logic for dynamic population of the page with documents from the backend.
        Organize documents in a user-friendly manner, possibly as a table or list, including document details like                 name, date, and metadata.
    3. User Interaction:
        Implement interactions, such as clicking on documents for access or download.
        Ensure a seamless user experience with clear navigation.

## Sub-Project 2: Update the Calculator for Enhanced Functionality
### Objectives
 
- Redesign the Front-End to have the new functions and features
- Extend Functionality by updating the files and adding more features
 
### Plan of Action
1. Requirement Analysis and Design
Define the requirements for the new functions required. Conduct meetings with the team members and TAs. Have clear requirements and a basic design for the new functions in the calculator.
2. Design and Prototyping
Create design prototypes for the new calculator interface. To Create and iterate on user interface prototypes by modifying file, such as “KeyPad.tsx”
3. Backend development
Update “FormulaEvaluator.ts” to add new functionalities. Write additional code for functionalities and integrate them with the existing system. Then, enhanced calculator functionalities were implemented and integrated.
4. Frontend development
Implement the new calculator design. Fully implemented the calculator interface with 13 new functions.
5. Testing
Conduct comprehensive testing on the updated calculator and address identified issues.
 
 
## Sub-Project 3: Show who is editing a cell
 
### Objectives
 
- Implement User Identification and display the name of the user currently editing a cell in the spreadsheet
- Improve the user experience in collaborative settings, making it clear who is editing which cell at any given time
- Ensure the new feature integrates with the existing spreadsheet
- Implement real-time updates so that all users can see the editing status instantly.
 
### Plan of Action
 
1. Requirement Analysis and Design
Define the specifications for the editing status feature. Conduct meetings with the team members and TAs. Have clear requirements and a basic design for displaying currently which user editing the cell.
2. Design and Prototyping
Design the system architecture and user interface for the editing status feature.
3. Backend and frontend development
Implement the editing status feature. Code the backend and frontend components of the feature, ensuring integration with existing systems. Then, fully implemented editing status feature.
4. Testing
Test the feature for functionality, usability, and integration. and address identified issues.
 
 
## Conclusion
 
This Discovery and Plan of Action document serves as the foundation for our approach to tackling the three sub-projects within A Better Calc/sheet. It provides a structured and organized roadmap that will guide our team's efforts. Regular review and updates will be conducted to ensure alignment with project goals and to address any changes or challenges that may arise.
