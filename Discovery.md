**Project Name:** A Better Calc/sheet

**Team Name:** Team Name

## Introduction
When a team undertakes a new task the first step in the process is often called Discovery.  The outcome of the discovery stage is a high-level plan of how to solve the problem.  In this particular exercise we want you to produce a document that outlines how your team is going to address tackling the three sub-projects.  This document should be your plan of action. 

## Part 1: File Selection

### Objectives

- have a file selector page
    - request a list of all the documents from the backend server
    - display them on a separate page

### Plan of Action
    1. Frontend Development:
        Create a dedicated web page for the file selector.
        Design an intuitive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    2. Document Listing:
        Develop logic for dynamic population of the page with documents from the backend.
        Organize documents in a user-friendly manner, possibly as a table or list, including document details like                 name, date, and metadata.
    3. User Interaction:
        Implement interactions, such as clicking on documents for access or download.
        Ensure a seamless user experience with clear navigation.
