## What worked well for your team

To ensure the success of our project, we've focused on several key practices. First, we established a clear timeline during our initial meeting, providing a roadmap for the project and setting expectations. This early planning has kept us organized and on track. We then prioritized efficient collaboration by leveraging GitHub's features, such as branches, to prevent code conflicts and ensure seamless integration.

Effective communication has been integral to our success, with regular meetings held at different project stages to share ideas, address concerns, and maintain collaboration. This staged communication strategy has kept all team members informed and aligned. Moreover, we've maintained a fair and even distribution of the workload among team members, enabling everyone to deliver their tasks effectively and ensuring steady project progress.

To further enhance our project, we've also emphasized thorough documentation, robust testing, and quality assurance, as well as proactive risk management. We encourage feedback and iteration, using it to make continuous improvements. Task tracking and project management tools have helped us stay organized, and we've actively involved clients or stakeholders throughout the process, aligning the project with their expectations and requirements. These combined practices have contributed to a streamlined development process and increased the likelihood of a successful project outcome. 

## What did not work well for your team and how will you address this for assignment 3 and the final project?

In the initial phases of our project, we encountered some challenges stemming from our approach to task assignment before achieving full team alignment. This occasionally led to discrepancies among group members regarding the best approach for their respective tasks. However, this valuable experience has served as a learning opportunity for us. As we move forward, we've recognized the need to prioritize clarity and synchronization among team members. To address this, we have decided to implement a more inclusive and collaborative approach, particularly during our early project meetings. This shift will ensure that we discuss and align on the codebase and project direction at an earlier stage, preventing potential misalignments and enhancing overall project cohesion.
